This is my WIP blender toolkit for working with KCD2 files in Blender 4.3.

The repo contains a custom branch of BCRY-Exporter, so make sure you remove the original addon if you have it installed.
This will (hopefully) be updated regularly, as I add/fix things.

Current features:
- Directly importing .skin files
- Vertex Colors (RGB and Alpha layers)
- Exporting to .skin
