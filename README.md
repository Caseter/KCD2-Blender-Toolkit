This is my WIP blender toolkit for working with KCD2 files in Blender 4.3.

The repo contains the `KCD2 Toolkit` blender addon and a custom branch of the `BCry Exporter` Addon, so make sure you remove the original addon if you have it installed.
This will (hopefully) be updated regularly, as I add/fix things.

You can find the import tools in the right hand side tabs, alongside BCry Exporter. Toggle this with `N` if you cant see it.

Current features:
- Directly importing .skin & .cgf files
- Vertex Colors (RGB and Alpha layers)
- Exporting to .skin & .cgf using a custom branch of BCry Exporter
